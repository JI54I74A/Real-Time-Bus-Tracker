# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

Using map animation the given co-ordinates of bus stops are showing with a marker and displaying those into the map.
This work is about showing bus stops between MIT and Harvard

## How to Run

There is button in the map page, after clicking the **Show stops** button the JavaScript written for showing markers(bus stops) 
activates and move the marker from starting stop from MIT and cover all the stops till Harward.
For viewing the map, our own access key have to create in mapbox site.

## Roadmap

A lot of updation needed to this excercise. I am planning to integrate an API to for the co-ordinates data instead of using static data.
I will make changes in the appearence and will create more user interactivness.
